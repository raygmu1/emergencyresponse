#Emergency Response
Code for Factual Awareness Simulations Response

This code base is provided for runnning simulations for the Factual Awareness strategies. The way to run these simulations is as follows:
1. On RStudio, clear memory.
2. Load the following functions:
   a. Opinion Update()
   b. random_gsimul_graph()
   c. Rinotth() and NSGS()
   d. rand_opinion_update()
   e. Mode()
3. Now, go to the main script in the file "random_graph_simulations_test.R"
4. Run the entire code.

The code usually takes about 14 hours to run. However, parallelization can help make it speed up.
